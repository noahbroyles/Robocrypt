# Robocrypt
## Super strong python3 encryption program with file and folder support

Due to the encryption algorithm in use here, large files should be be encrypted with this tool. Robocrypt keeps data in memory while encrypting/decrypting, so depending on the RAM in your system there will be a limit on the size of files you can encrypt with this tool.

Robocrypt is amazing for encrypting small files and folders with sensitive data. I guarantee that ain't nobody gonna break the encryption, unless you use a shitty password.
