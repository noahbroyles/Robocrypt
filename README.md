# Robocrypt
## Super strong python3 encryption program with file and folder support

With Robocrypt you can encrpyt/decrypt messages, files, or folders using a password.
Don't look at the code too hard... It's messy. I modifed an old program to use stronger encryption.

_TO DO_: Clean up and modularize code

### To get started:
`python3 -m pip install cryptography`

### To Encrypt / Decrypt a message:
Run `python3 Robocrypt.py`. Follow the prompts for Encryption / Decryption.

### To Encrypt / Decrypt a file or folder:
Run `python3 Robocrypt.py <path/to/thing>`. Follow the prompts.
